# Frequently Asked Questions

## 1. Compose Services ![Compose Services](img/compose-services.svg)

**I installed Compose Services, how do I create a program and a project?**

Please refer to corresponding
[Gen3 Documentation](https://gen3.org/resources/operator/#5-programs-and-projects)
to create your first program and project.


**I created a program, but I see `NotFound` error when I try to create a
project within my program.**

Please make sure you inserted program `name` in the URL, not
`dbgap_accession_number`.


**I can not submit data to the project I just created.**

Please ensure you granted yourself permissions in the `user.yaml` file. You can
find this file in the `Secrets` folder within your Compose Services folder.
Follow provided in the file example to grant yourself relevant permissions. You
can find more information in the
[Setting Up Users](https://github.com/uc-cdis/compose-services#setting-up-users)
documentation.

**User.yaml contains information about program/project, but I still can not
access it.**

Please ensure you are using `dbgap_accession_number` value as an identifier for
the `auth_id` field, not program's `name` or project's `code`.

**I see a warning about my connection is not being private.**

Don't worry. The warning about connection not being private appears because
`creds_setup.sh` script generated self-signed SSL certificate to allow
microservices to communicate with each other without bypassing SSL verification.
Your browser can not verify this certificate. Once you install a trusted SSL
certificate instead of generated by our script, this warning will go away.

**I want to run Compose Services on the server, how to configure
 it.**

To configure Compose Services with your domain, please change the `BASE_URL`
field in the `fence_config.yaml` file, and the `hostname` field in the
`peregrine.json`, `sheepdog.json` files.

**I'm trying to upload files with gen3-client, but receive an error 
`x509: certificate signed by unknown authority`.**

You can add self-signed certificate to your trusted certificates. Steps may
vary depending on Operating System you use.
